# Video Alias
A Study on the Aliasing Effect on Video

## Description

The goal of this project is to execute a study on the behavior of sound waves and video capture when their frequencies are matched.
We successfully induced the temporal aliasing effect on a video when recording a water stream exposed to an audio source at the same frequency of the camera's.
The audio source is produced by a simple Matlab script and a speaker.
